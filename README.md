# GA WDI-32 Project 2 - Tag-Mate

I've always been a big fan of art and specifically street art, so for my second project I decided to create an app for users to share street art which is called Tag-Mate. Tag-Mate allows users to share art that they've spotted but also use the website as a directory of what street art is out there and in what cities.

 Tag-Mate is a full-stack, RESTful Express app built using Node.js, MongoDB, JavaScript, EJS and SCSS.

To improve this app further I'd like to be able to include functionality that allows users to upload images via FileStack and I'm keen to include moderation.


##  Setup Instructions
* Install Dependencies with 'yarn install'
* Start local MongoDB server in Node.js with 'mongod'
* Launch app with 'node index'
